            <h3>Revolutionized the WORLD</h3>
            My condolences go out to Steve himself, his family, friends, coworkers, and all the others who have been impacted by him in one way or another. He literally revolutionized the world. Being born in the early 90's I have grown up with all types of computers / cd players / and entertainment devices that today do not even compare to the pure genius of Apple's products. His brilliance in such a renowned company has changed the lives of everyone! Such a powerful man will never, ever be forgotten. Life began with an apple and for Steve Jobs, he can lay to rest knowing he gave LIFE to "Apple" Rest in Peace, Steve Jobs .. You are in my thoughts and prayers.

            <h3>Steve Jobs genius</h3>
            I am so sad to loose a beautiful mind in a teenager outgoing look. He connected me again with Apple years ago with brilliant new technologies mixed with a young, fresh and very appealing features. I am going to miss his incredible personality. Humble person...with genius
