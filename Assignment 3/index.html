                The world has truly lost an unparalleled visionary. Someone like him is a person that will be remembered for decades, if not centuries, to come for what he has done in so many areas. I remember racing classmates in elementary school for the Macs to play Brick Break. I grew up with movies like Toy Story, A Bug's Life, and Toy Story 2. I continue to wait anxiously for their next movie, even as an adult in my mid-20's. To this day, I love my Apple products and wait baited breath for the next revolutionary device/software to show what devices can truly achieve. My thoughts and prayers go out to the Jobs family and those fortunate enough to call him a friend. <br>

                <h3>Thank you, Steve</h3>
                Thank you so much to Mr. Jobs for all the joy that he gave and will continue to give to me with all things Apple. I am saddened that he has passed away at such a young age, but oh my, all that he accomplished in his short years is extraordinary. He was a man with an incredible mind and a kind, giving heart. I send my sympathy to his family and friends. <br>
